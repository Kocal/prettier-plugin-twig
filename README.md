# [DEAD] Prettier plugin for Twig

This plugin has been stopped for many reasons:
  - I didn't have time for it, I have a full-time job and other projects to work on,
  - It was really hard and time-consuming for me, I had to _learn_ how to write a Prettier plugin, how to test it, how to parse Twig code to an AST, how to use it correctly in Prettier's `print` method, etc... that's not easy! 
  - Finally Trivago released a Prettier plugin for Twig: https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-twig-melody

I've failed [my mission](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/5944#issuecomment-470043787), but now we have a plugin for Twig! :smile:

This repository is now archived.
